# MapScripts
nasafrasa's inefficient scripts!

Hello! Welcome to where I store all my scripts for my maps! Don't copy anything big because #1: that's mean and unoriginal and #2 they're very inefficient so why would you steal them anyway lmao. Anyways you can look around and cringe at the code I made and give feedback I guess.

I'm now also using this repo to just store all of the stuff I made for ReMapper/Beat Saber mapping in general.
